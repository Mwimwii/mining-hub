                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and
                    mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
                    not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. However, no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                    been finalized at this stage. As such, we do not currently
                    respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
                    must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
                    practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
